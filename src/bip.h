/**
 * bipart recommandation is carried on between two kinds of objects, such as user and item. 
 * Here, I use "left" and "right" to represent these two kinds. Conventionly, left represent user and right represent item.
 * maybe a biparte can contain some extra attributes, like score that a user give to a item. but any attribute can be treated as a param.
 * this is more flexible.
 *
 * for struct BIP:
 * 		the origin bipartite is coming from a struct LineFile with using createBIP(struct LineFile) function.
 * 		(BTW, the origin LineFile is getting from a file which contain at least two int integer in an line)
 *
 * 		struct BIP contains only half information of the bipartite. 
 * 		(I mean one struct Bip can store a LineFile completely, but it doesn't store detail information.)
 * 		you need two struct Bip to store all detail information of a Bipartite.
 * 		one is indexed by i1(left).
 * 		one is indexed by i2(right).
 *
 * struct METRICS contains the result(all metrics) for all kinds of recommendation algorithm.
